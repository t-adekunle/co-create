# Co-create

Co Create is a live editor which allows user to collaborate on documents in real time. This was created as part of my final group project at Northcoders. The app allows users to create a new account and sign in using an existing account. Once logged in, they can access previously saved files or create a new document. Using the customizable functionality of tip tap, the text editor offers a range of formatting and editing options. Users can also leave comments with edit suggestions. 

If we had enough time, I would have loved to include an instant messaging and video call feature so that users could stay in touch in one app while collaborating. I would also like to expland the capabilities of the editor to include allow for a greater range of projects for collaboration such as drawing, images, video or code.
